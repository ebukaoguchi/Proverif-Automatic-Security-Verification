# Proverif-Automatic-Security-Verification
Mutual Authentication and Message Integrity Verification
This project aims to provide Message Integrity Verification and Mutual authentication in a smart home scenario where there is a Server, an IoT device, and a Smartphone user. Mutual authentication is when the sides of a communication channel verify each other. It is a two-way authentication because it goes in both directions. Message Integrity verification is a way of ensuring that the message received has not been tampered with. These are very important to guarantee security from a rogue network.
Proverif is a software tool for evaluating several cryptographic protocols and primitives including symmetric and asymmetric cryptography.

This project outlines 3 parts protocol design namely,
1. Mutual authentication between the IoT and the server.
2. Mutual authentication between the smartphone user and the server.
3. Data Integrity and Confidentiality for messages sent by the IoT devices to the server.
