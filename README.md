Mutual Authentication and Message Integrity Verification
This project aims to provide Message Integrity Verification and Mutual authentication in a smart home scenario where there is a Server, an IoT device, and a Smartphone user. Mutual authentication is when the sides of a communication channel verify each other. It is a two-way authentication because it goes in both directions. Message Integrity verification is a way of ensuring that the message received has not been tampered with. These are very important to guarantee security from a rogue network.
